# üìä TheDataImmersed SQL Project ‚Äì Week 1

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is part of *TheDataImmersed Community SQL Practice*, aimed at helping analysts strengthen their SQL foundations through real-world-inspired tasks.  

In *Week 1*, we explored the essentials of SQL, database management, and fundamental query structures.  

## *Objectives:*  
- Understand relational databases.  
- Use core SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY).  
- Create and modify tables.  
- Insert, update, and retrieve data from a sample dataset.

## üîë Key Learnings  
1. *SQL in Action* ‚Äì Useful for analyzing datasets such as customer orders in e-commerce to determine best-selling products by region.  
2. *Data Integrity* ‚Äì Maintained through constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK).  
3. *DBMS Role* ‚Äì Tools like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server execute SQL queries while ensuring data storage, security, and efficiency.  
4. *Database vs Table* ‚Äì A database is like a library, while a table is like a book inside that library.

## üóÇ Dataset Description  
We worked with a hypothetical *Books Dataset* containing the following fields:  

- book_id (integer, primary key)  
- title (text)  
- author (text)  
- genre (text)  
- year_published (integer)  
- price (numeric)

## ‚öô SQL Tasks & Queries  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Table  
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    author TEXT,
    genre TEXT,
    year_published INT,
    price NUMERIC
)
```sql
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Insert Records
```sql
INSERT INTO books (book_id, title, author, genre, year_published, price)
VALUES
(1,'The Great Gatsby', 'F.Scott','Fiction', '1925', '10.99'),
(2, 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen', 'Fiction','1813','8.99'),
(3, 'Cosmos', 'Carl Sagan','Science', '1980', '12.5'),
(4, 'Sapiens', 'Yuval Noah', 'History', '2011', '15'),
(5, 'Atomic Habits', 'Adam Sandler', 'Self-Help', '2018', '14.99'),
(6, '1984', 'George Orwell', 'Fiction', '1949', '9.99'),
(7, 'Educated', 'Tara Westover', 'Memoir','2018', '13.99'),
(8, 'The Gene', 'Siddhartha', 'Science', '2016', '14.5'),
(9, 'The Alchemist', 'Paulo Coelho', 'Fiction', '1988', '7.99'),
(10, 'Guns, Germs, Steel', 'Jared Diamond', 'History', '1997', '16')
```sql


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve Books with Price > $10
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM books
WHERE price > 10;
```sql

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve Titles & Prices of Books Published After 2000 (Descending Order)
```sql
SELECT title, price
FROM books
WHERE year_published > 2000
ORDER BY price DESC
```sql

‚úÖ Explanation:

SELECT ‚Üí Chooses title and price columns.

FROM ‚Üí Uses the books table.

WHERE ‚Üí Filters books published after 2000.

ORDER BY ‚Üí Sorts results by descending price.



---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Update Author Name
```sql
UPDATE books
SET author = 'James Clear'
WHERE title = 'Atomic Habits';
```sql

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Add New Books
```sql
INSERT INTO books (book_id, title, author, genre, year_published, price)
VALUES
(11, 'Thinking, Fast and Slow', 'Daniel Kahneman', 'Psychology', 2011, 18.99),
(12, 'The Power of Habit', 'Charles Duhigg', 'Self-Help', 2012, 12.99);
```sql

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve Only Title & Genre
```sql
SELECT title, genre
FROM books;
```sql

---

## üìå Conclusion

This project introduced the basics of SQL through hands-on practice involving:

- Table creation

- Data insertion

- Data retrieval (filtering, sorting, selecting specific columns)

- Record updates and additions


It reinforces the importance of data integrity, query structuring, and the role of DBMS in managing relational databases.

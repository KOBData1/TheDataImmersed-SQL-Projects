## TDI Week 1 Project
### üìö SQL Books Database Project 

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a Books database using SQL. The main objective is to practice fundamental SQL operations, including table creation, data insertion, data retrieval, updating records, and ordering results.

### üîë Key Features:
- Database Creation: A Books table was created with attributes such as Book_id, Title, Author, Genre, Year_published, and Price
- Data Insertion: Inserted 10 initial book records covering multiple genres (Fiction, Science, History, Self-Help, Memoir). Additional books were added later to expand the dataset.
- Data Retrieval:
Retrieved all books priced above $10.
Fetched books published after 2000, sorted by price in descending order.
Displayed only the Title and Genre columns for a simplified view.
- Data Update: Corrected an author name (Atomic Habits author updated from Adam Sandler to James Clear).
- Data Expansion: Added two more influential books (Thinking, Fast and Slow and The Power of Habit).

### üõ†Ô∏è SQL Concepts Covered:
- DDL (Data Definition Language): Creating tables with appropriate data types and constraints.
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): Inserting, updating, and deleting records.
- DQL (Data Query Language): Writing queries with conditions, filtering, and sorting.
- Data Integrity: Ensuring unique primary keys and correcting inaccurate data.

### üìà Learning Outcomes:
This project showcases how to:
- Structure a relational database table.
- Insert and manipulate real-world datasets.
- Write queries to retrieve targeted information.
- Apply updates and maintain data consistency.

#### üëâ This project can serve as a foundation for larger database systems such as a library management system, online bookstore database, or reading tracker.

## TDI Week 4 Project

### üçï SQL Pizza Sales Business Analysis
This project applies SQL queries to a pizza sales database to answer 20 real-world business and technical questions. The focus is on exploring customer behavior, product performance, revenue trends, and operational efficiency while also demonstrating theoretical SQL knowledge.
